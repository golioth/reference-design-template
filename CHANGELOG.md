# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [template_v2.4.0] - 2024-09-05

### Changed

- Upgrade to Golioth Firmware SDK at
  [`v0.15.0`](https://github.com/golioth/golioth-firmware-sdk/releases/tag/v0.15.0)
- Add sample `pipeline` to configure routing stream data (See [Data
  Routing](https://docs.golioth.io/data-routing) documentation)
- Upgrade `golioth/golioth-zephyr-boards` dependency to
  [`v2.0.0`](https://github.com/golioth/golioth-zephyr-boards/releases/tag/v2.0.0).
    - Update board names to match this change
- Upgrade `golioth/zephyr-network-info` dependency to
  [`v1.2.0`](https://github.com/golioth/zephyr-network-info/releases/tag/v1.2.0)
- Upgrade `golioth/libostentus` dependency to
  [`v2.0.0`](https://github.com/golioth/libostentus/releases/tag/v2.0.0)
- Use VERSION file to indicate version number of firmware being built. This number is used by
  MCUboot to verify the correct version is running after an OTA firmware update.

## [template_v2.3.0] - 2024-06-24

### Changed

- Upgrade to Golioth Firmware SDK at v0.14.0
- Use CBOR instead of JSON when sending stream data.
- Upgrade `golioth/golioth-zephyr-boards` dependency to
  [`v1.2.0`](https://github.com/golioth/golioth-zephyr-boards/tree/v1.2.0).

## [template_v2.2.1] - 2024-05-31

### Changed

- Upgrade to Golioth Firmware SDK at v0.13.1

## [template_v2.2.0] - 2024-05-28

### Changed

- Upgrade to Golioth Firmware SDK at v0.13.0
- Change `golioth_lightdb_observe_async()` call to include content type as a parameter

## [template_v2.1.0] - 2024-05-06

### Added

- Add support for the Aludel Elixir (`aludel_elixir_ns`) board.

### Fixed

- Fix typo (`app_sensors_read_and_steam` â†’ `app_sensors_read_and_stream`)
- Fix RPC registration error handling
- Fix an issue on boards using LTE connectivity where the Golioth Client was not
  started automatically (see
  https://github.com/golioth/reference-design-template/pull/92 for details).

### Changed

- Upgrade to Golioth Firmware SDK at v0.12.2
- Change `app_sensors_init` to `app_sensors_set_client`. On cellular boards,
  `app_sensors_set_client` is not guaranteed to run before
  `app_sensors_read_and_stream`, so any sensor initialization should moved to a
  separate function (e.g. `app_sensors_init`) that runs before
  `app_sensors_read_and_stream`.

### Removed

- Remove unused `click-i2c` alias from nRF DK boards.

## [template_v2.0.0] - 2024-02-21

### Breaking Changes

- Migrate to Golioth Firmware SDK at v0.10.0
  - All header file and API call names have changed
  - Many Golioth Kconfig symbols have changed
  - OTA firmware update code is greatly simplified

### Added

- GitHub Actions workflows to build release binaries

### Changed

- Firmware version number is now passed as a symbol in the prj.conf file and not as a build argument
- Use LTE Link handler from Golioth Common Library
  - The majority of LTE Link handler callback is logging so this has been reused from the common
    library
  - An additional callback is registered in the application just to service on-connect events
- Board definitions related to Ostentus face place moved to a common file that may be included when
  needed

## [template_v1.2.0] - 2023-11-08

### Added

- GitHub workflow to create draft release and add compiled binaries to it.

### Changed

- Update to most recent Golioth Zephyr SDK release v0.8.0 which uses:
  - nRF Connect SDK v2.5.0(NCS)
  - Zephyr v3.5.0
- Upgrade `golioth/golioth-zephyr-boards` dependency to [`v1.0.1`](https://github.com/golioth/golioth-zephyr-boards/tree/v1.0.1)
- Dependencies use https instead of ssh GitHub URLs
- libostentus removed from code base and included as a Zephyr module
- renamed app_work.c/h to app_sensors.c/h

### Fixed

- Fix build error when `CONFIG_LIB_OSTENTUS=n` on the `aludel_mini_v1_sparkfun9160` board.

## [template_v1.1.0] - 2023-08-18

- update board config for nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns and aludel_mini_v1_sparkfun9160_ns
- update LTE link control: Disable samples/common link control and use in-app link control to start
  connection asynchronously

### Fixed

- main.c: return int from main()
- battery_monitor.c: use void as initialization param
- main.c: use LOG_ERR() instead of printk() for button errors
